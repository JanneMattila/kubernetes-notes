# Kubernetes notes

Collection of my different Kubernetes notes mostly in context of 
[Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/) or
[Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-arc/kubernetes/overview)
but also some that are also relevant for vanilla [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/).

## Playgrounds

Different playgrounds have been created for testing very specific scenario.
They also contain simple deployment script either written in
`bash` or `PowerShell` which you can run [line by line](https://github.com/JanneMattila/some-questions-and-some-answers/blob/master/q%26a/vs_code.md#automation-tip-shift-enter)
and replicate that environment for your own testing purposes.
